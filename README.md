Hey guys, this is SaberAkiyama here.

I have very bad news for all the users. My sister bought back her laptop and I don't have my own laptop or PC to work on my Rainmeter projects. I don't know what to say because I want to work on my projects.

I don't have money or anything else like a lonely person. If I want a giveaway by someone else, it might be a chance to work for my projects.

If you have any questions, let me know in direct message on Discord, click "Add Friend", type ```SaberAkiyama#7001``` *(or copy and paste on username)* and click/touch "Send Friend Request".

**Hear me out!**

I was wondering if I get a PC or laptop from someone, it might be a chance for my projects. I am trying to get this pre-build PC or laptop with a cooling fan. If I get it, yes. If not, I don't know.

My wishlist for a pre-build PC is AMD Ryzen 5000 series CPU, 16 or 32 GB of RAM, 500GB of NVMe storage for main storage (AKA a boot drive), 1 or 2 TB of SSD storage for secondary drive and RTX 3050 or 3060 GPU.

My wishlist for a laptop is AMD Ryzen series laptop CPU from ASUS ROG Zephyrus, MSI Gaming laptop or Lenovo Legion.

Both are my wishlist for AMD setup. And I hope I get it.
