Hey guys, this is SaberAkiyama here.

I have very bad news for all the users. My sister bought back her laptop and I don't have my own laptop or PC to work on my Rainmeter projects. I don't know what to say because I want to work on my projects.

I don't have money or anything else like a lonely person. If I want a giveaway by someone else, it might be a chance to work for my projects.

If you have any questions, let me know in the comments section below, if you want.
